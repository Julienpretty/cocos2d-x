/*

This class serves two purposes:

    1) Record the latest mouse position, which is required in couple of places (eg. the mouse wheel events don't hold the current position)
    2) Re-inject the latest mouse position every once a while, thus providing a quick (& dirty) solution to the updates happening in the scene.
        This allows us to handle scene updates (eg. a button/sprite that ended being under/off the cursor, or got enabled/disabled) in a fairly easy way.
